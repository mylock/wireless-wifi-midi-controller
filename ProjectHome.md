This is a wireless WiFi controller for any MIDI devices. The user can use a mobile phone or similar mobile device to control any device with a MIDI interface. For example, this system can be used for live musical performance. Viewers can play via their mobile phones along with the musicians and can create an improvised performance. (Android device, ADK or Arduino, MIDI and WiFly shields, MIDI device.)

**Modules:**
  * android (master keyboard controller application)
  * arduino (Arduino/ADK sketch)
  * test (UDP Client ...)


**I apologize for using absolute layout for the keyboard which was tested at a resolution of 800 x 480 (Nexus S).**
